                            HexaFinity is a next-generation decentralized
                            exchange (DEX) that enables lightning-fast trades at
                            a low fee. We are the only DEX that offers variable
                            fees as low as 0%, along with trading rewards. We
                            combine Dex services with DeFi to offer Lending &
                            Borrowing functions, Time Deposit Staking, and Yield
                            farming. In addition, we are an automated market
                            maker (AMM) built on the Binance Smart Chain.

                            As of right now, DeFi is still growing and operates
                            in slightly uncharted territory. However, many
                            innovations are to be incorporated and many security
                            features to be built, so make sure that you research
                            and study everything accordingly and attentively
                            before jumping into any project. We want to see
                            Binance develop a system lock in place that makes it
                            impossible for developers to act untruthfully
                            towards users.

                            HexaFinity is an automated market maker (AMM) built
                            on the Binance Smart Chain. HexaFinity automated the
                            order process of the Binance order book. Our
                            decentralized exchange (DEX) enables lightning-fast
                            trades with low fees from (0% to 0.2%). We are the
                            only DEX that offers variable fees as low as 0%,
                            along with trading rewards. We combine Dex services
                            with DeFi to offer Lending & Borrowing functions,
                            Time Deposit Staking, Non-fungible Tokens, and Yield
                            farming. HexaFinity enables users to trade freely,
                            peer-to-peer, with liquidity that other users
                            supply. This means that new projects can easily
                            connect to their desired markets as long as some
                            entity is willing to provide the liquidity. BSC was
                            chosen over other blockchains because of Binance
                            Smart Chain reliability, scalability, and security.

                            is a standard feature on other AMM platforms;
                            however, the cost-effectiveness and simplicity of
                            executing swaps along with many rich DeFi features
                            will lead the way to adopt the crypto ecosystem.

                            Liquidity vault are places to store tokens (which we
                            sometimes call liquidity) to use to make trades in a
                            decentralized way. These vaults are created by users
                            and decentralized apps (or Dapps, for short) who
                            want to profit from their usage. To store liquidity,
                            the amounts a user supplies must be equally divided
                            between two coins: the primary token and the second
                            token. You can only swap tokens on HexaFinity if
                            there is enough liquidity for those tokens to be
                            swapped. If nobody has added liquidity for the
                            tokens or tokens you want to swap, it will be
                            difficult, expensive, or impossible to do so.
                            Providing liquidity will get you LV Tokens, which
                            will earn you rewards in the form of trading fees
                            for providing liquidity for the exchange to use.

                            HexaFinity provides advantages over the traditional
                            financial product by eliminating the middlemen,
                            providing global and equal access, and allowing
                            users full control of their funds at all times. Why
                            pay higher fees? With variable trading fees for
                            regular and VIP users. Our trading fees vary from
                            0.2% to 0%, which are lower than most exchanges.
                            When a regular user makes a swap on the exchange, a
                            trading fee of 0.2% will be charged, which is
                            distributed in the following way: 0.1% - Returned to
                            Liquidity Vault in the form of a fees reward for
                            liquidity providers. 0.06% - Sent to the HexaVault
                            0.04% - HEXA buyback and burn

                            Our trading fees are different for regular and VIP
                            users. Our variable trading fees range between 0.2%
                            to 0%. Our typical fee is 0.2% for swapping tokens,
                            0.03% staking fee, and 0.2% unstaking fees. In
                            addition, 0.01% of the total fees are redeposited
                            into the Infinity Pool and reward Yield Farmers.
                            Additionally, 0.006 is sent to the HexaVault Staking
                            Pool and rewards those staking their HEXA and other
                            tokens; the 0.004% remaining is used to buy back and
                            burn HEXA. Swapping fees are immediately deposited
                            into liquidity reserves. This increases the value of
                            liquidity tokens, functioning as a payout to all
                            liquidity providers proportional to their share of
                            the vault. Fees are collected by burning liquidity
                            tokens to remove a proportionate share of the
                            underlying reserves.

                            Cryptocurrencies' primary advantages are low
                            transaction costs, international borderless
                            transferability and convertibility, trustless
                            ownership and exchange, pseudo-anonymity, real-time
                            transparency, and immunity from legacy banking
                            system problems. Common explanations for the current
                            limited mainstream use of cryptocurrencies include
                            volatile price swings, inadequate market
                            understanding of the technology, insufficient

                            <b>Ms. Suzy, </b>the lender, deposits her BNB into
                            the Vault; his assets become available to borrow for
                            a farmer of leveraged yield farming or a trader of
                            farming trading; he earns returns from debt
                            interests paid by farmers or traders borrowed BNB
                            from the Bank.<br></br>
                            <br></br>
                            Mr. Derick, the yield farmer, wants to open a
                            leveraged yield farming position on the BNB/HEXA
                            pair with 3x leverage; he borrows BNB from the Vault
                            and enjoys 3 times of yield farming rewards while
                            being obligated to pay back equal value BNB and pay
                            borrowing interest when closing positions.<br></br>
                            <br></br>
                            Mr. Robert, the margin trading investor, is
                            optimistic about BNB. She can open a long position
                            for BNB with 6 times leverage through HexaFinity,
                            providing BNB as a principal and borrowing USDT from
                            HexaFinity Vault to buy BNB and entrust it to
                            HexaFiity Vault Contract. Ms. C will pay borrowing
                            interest to HexaFinity Vault for the USDT loan and
                            get 6 times amplified gains from the rise in BNB
                            price.<br></br>
                            <br></br>
                            Mr. Sheldon enjoys low risk earning; so, he
                            Time-Locked his HEXA token, earning up to 60% APY
                            while avoiding high-risk trading.<br></br>
                            <br></br>
                            Ms. Bayleigh is tired of paying high exchange fees;
                            so, she turned to HexaFinity protocol and held a
                            5.6m HEXA token, and by doing this, she avoided
                            paying the exchange fees.<br></br>
                            <br></br>
                            Use Case #2<br></br>
                            <br></br>
                            Without any bankers or third parties involved, the
                            protocol will calculate his collateral value and let
                            him take an over-collateralized loan on it. He
                            borrows USDC instantly and uses his crypto exchange
                            account to convert it into local fiat currency. Now
                            Derick has enough funds to buy his dream house while
                            waiting for the markets. He is not obliged to make
                            any monthly payments, and his collateral
                            appreciation can be used in his favor. He can make
                            payments at any time and pay no additional interest
                            as interest rates are compounded per block.<br></br>
                            <br></br>
                            Lastly, Derick has been paying attention to DeFi and
                            all the new yield farming high APY returns he could
                            earn. These potential earnings may be short-lived
                            but are fundamental for the time being. How does
                            Derick take advantage of this? Does he want to jump
                            through hurdles to get some of his collateral out to
                            stake crypto on another protocol? No â€“ Derick wants
                            a one-stop-shop solution so he can participate in
                            yield farming quickly. Within the dashboard or the
                            smart contracts, she can stake crypto without any
                            central authority and use the reward earned from
                            crypto staking onto the latest DeFi yield farming
                            project with ease.<br></br>
                            <br></br>
                            Use Case #3<br></br>
                            <br></br>
                            Derick wants to buy his new dream house, but the
                            bankers have declined his application. Derick has
                            been a cryptocurrency advocate for years and has a
                            good portfolio but doesn't want to expose herself to
                            capital gains tax to sell the asset or earn any
                            potential appreciation. Then again, Derick believes
                            in the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies as
                            she believes in the mid and long-term growth of the
                            asset class. So what does Derick do? He can't use
                            his bank to borrow money from his asset class. He
                            can't sell at the moment and expose herself to taxes
                            and missing opportunities.<br></br>
                            <br></br>
                            Derick turns to the HexaFinity protocol using the
                            token canal project to move his XRP from the XRP
                            Ledger to the Binance Smart Chain with no fees. He
                            then utilizes his browser and the internet to access
                            the HexaFinity Dashboard and supplies his XRP to the
                            protocol. He is now benefiting from the potential
                            price appreciation of her XRP while earning a modest
                            APY on his supply. He then prepares to take a loan
                            in USDC by calculating how much he needs, then
                            utilizing the dashboard to take the loan.<br></br>
